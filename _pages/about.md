I am currently a 5th year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington, advised by [Yen-Chi Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yenchic/).

My current research interests are primarily in missing data with applications to Alzheimer's disease research.  I am also interested in causal inference and nonparametric statistics methods.  I am very grateful to be supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Previously, I received my BSc in Statistics and BSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Florida in 2019.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, painting (oil and digital), and exploring the beautiful Pacific NW.
