I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington, advised by [Professor Yen-Chi Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yenchic/).

My current research interests are primarily in missing data with applications to Alzheimer's disease research.  I am also interested in causal inference and nonparametric statistics methods.  I am very grateful to have been supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

Prior to graduate school, I received my BSc in Statistics and BSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Florida in 2019.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, pursuing various artistic endeavors (oil and digital painting, wheel throwing), attending symphonies/musicals, and exploring the beautiful Pacific NW.
